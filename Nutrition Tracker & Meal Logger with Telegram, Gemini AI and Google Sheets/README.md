📋 Description
This n8n template creates a Telegram-based Nutrition AI Assistant 🥑🔥 designed as an open-source alternative to the Cal AI mobile app.
It allows users to interact with an AI agent via text, voice, or images to track meals, calculate macros, and monitor nutrition goals directly from Telegram.

The system integrates Google Sheets as the database, handling both user profiles and meal logs, while leveraging Gemini AI for natural conversation, food recognition, and daily progress reports.

✨ Key Features
💬 Multi-input support: Text, voice messages (transcribed), and food images (AI analysis).

📊 Macro calculation: Automatic estimation of calories, proteins, carbs, and fats.

📝 User-friendly registration: Simple onboarding without storing personal health data (no weight/height required).

🎯 Goal tracking: Users can set and update calorie and protein targets.

📈 Daily reports: Personalized progress messages with visual progress bars.

🗂 Google Sheets integration:

Profile table for user targets.
Meals table for food logs.
🔄 Advanced n8n nodes: Includes use of Merge, Subworkflow, and Code nodes for data processing and report generation.

💡 Acknowledgment
Inspired by the Cal AI concept 💡 — this template demonstrates how to reproduce its main functionality with n8n, Telegram, and AI agents as a flexible, open-source automation workflow.
