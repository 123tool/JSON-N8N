Google Calendar MCP â€“ Context-Aware Calendar Operations
This n8n template implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol)-compliant module for managing Google Calendar events in a context-aware, conflict-free manner.

ðŸ§  What It Does
This MCP enables structured interaction with Google Calendar based on context and intent, ensuring reliable, reusable operations with awareness of existing data and state.

âœ… Core Capabilities
Context-aware event creation
Prevents overlapping by validating time availability before creating new events.

Gap validation
Checks if a time range is busy or free, enabling smarter scheduling decisions.

Conditional updates
Only updates events after confirming their existence and current state.

Safe deletion
Removes events using MCP principles of validation and traceability.

ðŸš€ How to Use
To use this MCP in your context-aware systems:

Deploy the template in your n8n instance.
Locate the Server node in the workflow â€” it exposes a Server-Sent Events (SSE) URL.
Copy that SSE URL.
Use that URL as the entry point for your MCP client or orchestrator.
This URL acts as the communication bridge, allowing you to interact with the MCP-compliant Google Calendar logic using standard MCP semantics.
